# library-repo

The goal of this project is to work collaboratively as a group utilizing Github to construct an app that will return results from the Library of Congress API.

The acceptance criteria for the project were as follows: homepage will have a simple and intuitive UI, will include a form field that will capture user input and communicate with the LOC API, returning search results onto a new page. From this page, we should be able to scroll through all results, as well as conducting a new search from the same page without returning to the "Home."

The task was broken up into milestones, with the minimum viable product being that we could enter information into a searach box and return results. From here, issues were assigned to the group and completed collaboratively via Git Projects.
